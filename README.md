# Behavioral Cloning Project

### Overview

In this project,  we use deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks to clone driving behavior. We train, validate and test a model using Keras for outputting a steering angle to an autonomous vehicle.  

We use image data and steering angles which are collected in the Udacity's [simulator](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim) to train a neural network and then use this model to drive the car autonomously around the track in simulator.

The main files in this project are: 
* model.py (script used to create and train the model)
* drive.py (script to drive the car - feel free to modify this file)
* model.h5 (a trained Keras model)
* video.mp4 (a video recording of your vehicle driving autonomously around the track for at least one full lap)

### Dependencies

(desktop computer 201G)

This lab requires [CarND Term1 Starter Kit](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit) The lab enviroment can be created with CarND Term1 Starter Kit. Click [here](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit/blob/master/README.md) for the details.

**You can setup dependent environment by yourself**

- A  virtual environment install with tensorflow and keras is required

- train.py

  ```
  pip install opencv-python
  pip install -U scikit-learn scipy matplotlib
  ```

- the tools for running drive.py

```
pip install python-socketio
pip install eventlet
pip install Pillow
pip install flask
```

- data.py



### Run

#### drive.py

Once the model has been saved, it can be used with drive.py using this command:

```sh
python drive.py model.h5
```

The above command will load the trained model and use the model to make predictions on individual images in real-time and **send the predicted angle back to the server via a websocket connection.**

Note: There is known local system's setting issue with replacing "," with "." when using drive.py. When this happens it can make predicted steering values clipped to max/min values. If this occurs, a known fix for this is to add "export LANG=en_US.utf8" to the bashrc file.

#### Saving a video of the autonomous agent

```sh
python drive.py model.h5 run1
```

The fourth argument, `run1`, is the directory in which to save the images seen by the agent. If the directory already exists, it'll be overwritten.

```sh
ls run1

```

The image file name is a timestamp of when the image was seen. This information is used by `video.py` to create a chronological video of the agent driving.

#### video.py

```sh
python video.py run1
```

Creates a video based on images found in the `run1` directory. The name of the video will be the name of the directory followed by `'.mp4'`, so, in this case the video will be `run1.mp4`.

Optionally, one can specify the FPS (frames per second) of the video:

```sh
python video.py run1 --fps 48
```

Will run the video at 48 FPS. The default FPS is 60.
